\section{ECCC Season Coordination Team}
\label{role:eccc_coordination_team}

Each collegiate cycling discipline raced in the ECCC has a set of staff members associated, led by
a \nsubsecref{role:eccc_season_coordinator}.

The \nsubsecref{role:eccc_director} oversees all season coordinators, and is available if students or staff have any questions.

% TODO: could use \begin{table} instead of \begin{figure}, but currently using figure as there are few tables,
% so there will be consistency as all included items are called "figure" and this will show up in the "List of Figures"
% Re-evaluate if there are many tables added.
