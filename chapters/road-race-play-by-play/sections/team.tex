\section{Assembling a Team}

A race weekend takes a large amount of work, and is near impossible for one person to handle alone.
However, planning and running the weekend can be simple if you have the right team to delegate work to.

Each race may divide responsibilities differently, especially if events are run by the conference
vs. being student run, but this play-by-play will describe work using a standard set of roles.

\subsubsection{Race Lead Organizer}

The \pbproleref{role:lead_org}%
\sidenote{%
  See \pgrefsubsec{role:lead_org} for a list of duties and responsibilities for this role.
}
is the first role that should be assigned.
This person must be part of the organization legally/financially hosting the race, and will be tasked with ensuring the success of the race
from start to finish.

For \nameref{sec:hosting:conference}, % TODO: better reference format
this will be the \pbproleref{role:eccc_season_coordinator}%
\sidenote{%
  See \frefsec{role:eccc_coordination_team} for information about the season coordinators,
  including the current season coordinators for each discipline.%
}.
For \nameref{sec:hosting:team},
this is typically a team member in a leadership position.
