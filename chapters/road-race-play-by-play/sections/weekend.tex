\section{Race Weekend}

It's now the night before the first race - hopefully all the planning and preparations listed above are complete!

This section will chronologically walk through a hypothetical race weekend from Friday night before the first race,
through the end of the last race on Sunday afternoon.

For this example, there will be a criterium on Saturday,
and a team time trial (TTT) % TODO: put in glossary
and road race held on Sunday.

You will notice that roles shift as we transition from planning to the weekend operations -
in the previous planning sections, the \pbproleref{role:lead_org} was tasked with most work.
During the weekend, the \pbproleref{role:primary_promoter} will take the primary responsibility for the event.

A few example emergencies are included in this section, based on actual emergencies that have happened at previous ECCC races
(with some details changed for anonymity).
While we've attempted to include some unusual cases, keep in mind that emergencies may happen at any time, and can be highly unique and unusual.
