This chapter will walk through the brainstorming,
planning, setup, execution, and post-event paperwork and tasks for a hypothetical collegiate road race weekend.%
\footnote{For a similar play-by-play description of a mountain race weekend,
see \nrefch{mtb-play-by-play}}

This chapter attempts to be generic, and should be applicable for both
\nfirstrefsec{hosting:conference} and
\nfirstrefsec{hosting:team}.
